What: Fullstack Node / ES6 / React platform for building next-gen, dependable, scalable, amazing apps.

Why: The only real ES6 stack with the fusion of Quality, UX and Delivery.

The 10 pillars of Basis:

* 100% (unit) testable - Reliable, dependable code...always
* ES6 / ES7 as 1st-class concern
* (True) Production Ready - Including logging, multi-environments, security, robestness, etc
* Push-button deployable - Deploy to PROD from initial clone
* Minimum Bolierplate - Minimum boilerplate / repetitive setup code / config from server, to build chain, to client (from project to project)
* Easy of Use (UX) - Easy to get up and running, easy to consume, easy to scale features, easy to deploy
* Versatile / Scalable - Can be used as true *basis* of everything, from static websites to complex enterprise applications
* Modular - Both in architecture (stack / npm packages), and in features from server to client
* Great UX - For everything...from Rest APIs, to errors, to logs, to build-chain, to deploys, to UI
* Enjoyable - Must be fun to use and build apps with

others ?

* Dogfooding - Everything that *can* be built with Basis IS built with basis.
* Extention - Easy to extend architecture for complex cases, easy to add core modules
* Performant - Everything from server, to build chain, to client is snappy and responsive
